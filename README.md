# Embedding and Extending Ansible with Python

Support material for the talk (code samples). The material is valid for Ansible v.1.9, probably won't fully work with v.2 as the Python API and plugins interface will be different.

Slides can be found [here](https://slides.com/alejandroguiraorodriguez/ee-ansible-with-python). A video of the talk can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLoBHbVb0Fw).

The Python dependencies can be installed running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
